Explain with proper examples what is meant by polymorphism in Python.

polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object oriented programming  that allows
object in different classes to be treated as a objects of a common base class.
it enables different object to respond to call same mthod call in different ways 
based on their specific implementation. polymorphism promotes code reuseblity, flexibility
and modularity. in python polymorphism is achieved through method overloading and
method overridding

Method overrriding:
Method overloading occurs when a subclass defines a method with the same name as A
method in the subclass replaces the method inheroted from the superclass.Allowing 
the subclass to provise it's specific implementation

    class animal:
        def sound(self):
            print("Animal make sound")
    
    class Dog(animal):
        def dog_sound(self):
            print("dog sound")
    
    class cat(animal):
        def cat_sound(self):
            print("Cat sound)

    animal.sound()
    output: Animal make sound
    dog.sound()
    output: dog cat_sound
    cat.sound()
    output: Cat sound


Method oveloading:
Method oveloading refers to defining multiple method with the same name but with 
different parameters or argument types. Python does not support oveloading is the 
traditional sense, as it does not allow multiple method wit the smae name in a class.
However polymorphic behaviour can be achieve by using  variable arguments(*args,
**Kwargs)to creat method that can handle different sets of arguments

clas Math:
    def add(self, x,y):
        return x+your
    def add(self, x,y,z)
        return x+y+z

result=math()
print(result.add(4,5))
output:9
print(result.add(5,6,7))
output:18
