Write down the differencesbetween class method and static method of Python with 
proper examples.(at least 3)

1. usage and accesssing method argument:
    class Method: A class method takes the classs itself as the first argument allowing 
    access to claa specific methods

    Myclass class:
        count =0

        @classmethod
        def increse_count(cls):
            self.count+=1

        @classmethod
        def get_count(cls):
            return cls.count

        print(Myclass.get_count())


    static Method: A static method does not have any special first argument. it behaves 
    like a regular function and does not have access to class specific attributes 
    or methods

    class Myresult:
        @staticmethod
        def add(a,b):
            return a+b

    result=add(3,4)
    print(result)


2. Accessing class attributes
    class Method: Class Methods can access and modify class attributes because they 
    recive the class as an argument

    classs circle:
        pi=3.1416

        def __init__(self, radious):
            self.radious=radious
        
        @classmethod
        def from_diameter(cls, diameter):
            radious=diameter/2
            return cls(radious)

    circle=circle.from_diameter(6)
    print(circle.radious)


    Static Method: static method can not access and modify class
    attributes directly, They believe like regularfunctions that
    are defined with class's namespace

    class circle:
        pi=3.1416

        def __init__(self, radious):
            self.radious=radious
        @staticmethod
        def calculate_area:
            return circle.pi*(self.radious**2)

        circle=circle(5)
        area=circle.calculate_area()

    Raises and attributeError


3. inheritance and overridding
    Class Method: class methods are inherited and can be overridden
    by subclasses. when a subclasses overrides a class method, The 
    subclass's implementation is called when the method are access 
    through a subclass

    class vehicle:
        @classmethod
        def print_description(cls):
            print("This is a vehicle")

    class car(vehicle):
        @classmethod
        def print_description(cls):
            print('This is car')

    vehicle.print_description()
    car.print_description()


    static Method: Static method are also inherited but they can not overridden by 
    subclasses. The static method of the parent clas will always be called, even 
    when accessed through a subclass

    class vehicle:
        @staticmethod
        def make_noise():
            print('not ok')
        
    class car(vehicle):
    @staticmethod
    def make_noise():
    print('ok')

    vehicle.make_noise()
    car.make_noise()
    output remain always not ok
