Multilevel inheritance in python refers to a scenario where a derived class(subclass)
inherits from another derived subclass(sub-subclass). In other words it involves in
creating a chain of inheritence with multiple levels. Each level represents 
a new class that inherits attributes and method from it's imediate superclass.
This allows for the reuse of code and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between
classes.


Here is the examples are given below:
class animal:
    def eat(self):
        print("animal is eating")
    
class dog(animal):
    def dog_sound(self):
        print("dog is making sound")

class cat(dog):
    def cat_sound(self):
        print("cat is making sound")


sound=animal()
sound.eat()          output: Animal is eating
sound.dog_sound()    output: dog is making sound
sound.cat_sound()    output: cat is making sound
