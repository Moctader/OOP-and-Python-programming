Write the advantages of using inner functions in Python OOP. Provide specific 
use cases where inner functions can enhance code readability and organization. 
(note: answer with proper examples).


Using inner function in oop can offer several advantages. include improve code readability
encapsulation and organization. Here are some use cases where the inner functions can
enhance the aspects:

1.encapsulation and information Hiding: 
Inner functions allows to encapsulate logic within a class, hiding in from
the outside world. They can be use to define helper functions or utility that are 
intended to use within the class, By keeping these functions as inner functions it
can not be used or accessed directly by external code.

class calculator:
    def calculate(self,a b):
        def add():
            return a+b
        
        def subtract():
            return a-b

        def multy():
            return a*b

        def divide():
            return a/b

        result={
            "addition"=add()
            "subtraction=subtract()
            "multipliction"=multy()
            "division"=divide()
        }

Here the inner function are encasulated within 'calculate()' method and are not 
intended for direct external access


2. improve code readability:

    Inner function can improve code readability by keeping related functionality 
    togather. It allows to define functions that are closely related to the maki
    logic of a class. making the code more organized and easier to understand. 
    inner function can also access the variables and parameters of the outer 
    function.promoting code reuse and reducing duplication
